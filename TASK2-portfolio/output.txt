What I do

Static Websites
A Static Website contains Web pages with fixed content. Each page is developed using HTML and CSS and displays the same information to every visitor.


Responsive Web design
Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user's behaviour and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.


Dynamic Website
A dynamic website is a website that changes as users interact with it. Dynamic websites allow for things like showing real time inventory and personalization by user.
